## Why this blog?

I would never be enough thankful to all of these bloggers I've read for years. Their blogs about web, dev and techs help me to grew up and become the developer I am today.

I think it's now time for me to give my contribution to this huge building of knowledge which Internet is, and humbly share what I've learn so far.

I hope the few posts on this blog would help at least someone, somewhere.

## Who am I?

My name is Arnaud Lenglet, I'm a French web developer, passionated by robotics and space conquest.
I've writen my first HTML lines of code at 12 in 2012, and since I've been though CSS, JS, PHP, Java, Andro√Ød, Python, Django and now Ruby on Rails, which I fall in love for 2 years.

Speaking about love, I'm married since 2014 to a beautiful and wonderful wife called Wendy.
We both believe in God, who's taking care and blessing us day after day for more than 5 years now.
I thank God everyday because I know everything comes from Him.
