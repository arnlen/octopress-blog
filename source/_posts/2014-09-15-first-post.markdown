I'm thinking about creating my own blog for years.
Today, I'm married for 1 month, I'm working as developer in a great startup, and the tech part I have in charge at church is on its good road.
If it could be a good time to start something new, I think it would be now!

I plan my first posts to be about experiences I encounter in my daily work - mainly Ruby on Rails and AngularJS ones.
I hope I will be able to write few things down at most once a week.

We'll see if I can handle it: answer next week! :)

BTW: I'm blogging using the Octopress blogging framework. After having worked with WordPress for years, this change is very pleasant and stimulant. Presenting it like this make me think it could be a good subject for a blog post... hmm...
